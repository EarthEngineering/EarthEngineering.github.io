## Introduction

Our goal with Facetop is to have a positive influence on the lives of people around the EARTH during the COVID-19 pandemic. We veiw pesonal protective equipment (PPE) as a practical way for us to make an impact and help return us back to some snese of normalcy.

We want everyone on EARTH to be able to create masks for themselves and their communities so we're releasing our designs as Open Source. These basic designs can be created with as simple supplies as t-shirt cloth and a needle and thread. Of course you can create them with much higher quality supplies too.

Our intention is to be selling them in our online store within a few weeks. We'll keep you posted as that comes together.

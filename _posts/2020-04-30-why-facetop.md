## Introduction

We believe that in crisis there is opportunity. We're a species of problem solvers and we have the wisdom needed to overcome nearly any crisis.

Part of our mission with Facetop is to take something which is being forced upon us during a time of fear and uncertainty, the mandatory wearing of a mask, and taking ownership of it and ultimately being empowered by it.

## Point of View

Facetop computing has been long overdue for a catalyst. Google Glass and subsequent "smart-glasses" haven't captured the public imagination. Mandatory masks worldwide represent an enormous opportunity for Facetop computing to go mainstream and it will usher in as large of a paradigm shift as Desktop and Mobile computing. 

Conventions and frameworks to protect privacy and provide developers the tools needed to create engaging and meaningful experiences will need to be developed. Facetop computing is a greenfield opportunity where everything is fresh and needs to be created in a way which best serves the new medium.

Instead of viewing the mask as a symbol of us losing our voices we view the mask as something which protects us, can be fashionable and connects us to the Internet of Things. Instead of masks representing us losing our identity, they can instead represent us embracing our pseudonymity.

## Black Swan

The COVID-19 Pandemic has been a black swan event which very few people were able to see coming. For the ones who did see it coming the rest of the world didn't take them seriously. The impact of this pandemic is unlike anything in modern history. It doesn't feel correct to compare it to a war or a terrorist attack but it's clear that it has already had a serious impact on the lives of people all over EARTH.

Our intention with EARTH, from day 1, has been to leverage emerging technologies to have a positive impact on the Human Condition. EARTH sit's at the intersection of the Web, the Blockchain and the Internet of Things and we intend to create disruptive technology and license it as open source to get in to the hands of as many people as possible and as quickly as possible.

## Join us

Masks are here to stay for at least a couple of years so we're choosing to be empowered instead of disempowered. We're choosing to view this an opportunity to have a positive impact on the lives of people during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as helping to take Facetop computing mainstream. I hope that you'll join me.

## Introduction

Since the very beginning of computing there has been the trend that processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers, doubles every two years.

This miniaturization is at the heart of our modern world where devices get better and more inexpensive continuously.

In popular culture this is known as [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) however we've witnessed it several times&mdash;Electro-Mechanical Calculators, Relay based computers which cracked the [German Enigma Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine), Vacuum Tubes which [predicted the election of Eisenhower](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2012/10/31/163951263/the-night-a-computer-predicted-the-next-president), [Discrete Transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) used in the first space flights and then Moore's Law where we shrink transistors on an [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit).

The trend manifests in many different digital fields of study including RAM, processor performance, average transistor price and microprocessor clock speed.

Also cost per transistor cycle, total bits shipped, magnetic data storage and many, many other fields.

The pace of change is itself accelerating. It took us 3 years to double the price performance of computing in 1900, 2 years in the middle of the century and we're now doubling it every 1 year.

### Networking

Not only is hardware getting smaller, faster and more inexpensive but networking is also growing exponentially. Here's the fastest possible data transmission speed.

## What does it all mean?

That's a lot of data. What does it all mean? It means that computers are continuously getting smaller, faster and more inexpensive and the trend is itself accelerating. As the cost and physical size of computing plummets and the capability skyrockets there are continuous opportunities to introduce computation into many different physical objects. This is known as the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) (IoT). Every single second 150 "smart" devices connect to the IoT.

## Definition of Facetop Computing

We define a Facetop Computer as a computer designed to be worn somewhere on your face or head. Included in this category are glasses, headsets and masks. As the price performance of smaller and smaller devices keeps improving it becomes more practical to build a high quality Facetop Computer. 

Facetop computing has been long overdue for a catalyst. Google Glass and subsequent "smart-glasses" haven't captured the public imagination. Mandatory masks worldwide represent an enormous opportunity for Facetop computing to go mainstream and it will usher in as large of a paradigm shift as Desktop and Mobile computing.

Conventions and frameworks to protect privacy and provide developers the tools needed to create engaging and meaningful experiences will need to be developed. Facetop computing is a greenfield opportunity where everything is fresh and needs to be created in a way which best serves the new medium.

Instead of viewing the mask as a symbol of us losing our voices we view the mask as something which protects us, can be fashionable and connects us to the Internet of Things. Instead of masks representing us losing our identity, they can instead represent us embracing our pseudonymity.

## Black Swan

![Black swan](/assets/black_swan.jpg)

The COVID-19 Pandemic has been a black swan event which very few people were able to see coming. For the ones who did see it coming the rest of the world didn't take them seriously. The impact of this pandemic is unlike anything in modern history. It doesn't feel correct to compare it to a war or a terrorist attack but it's clear that it has already had a serious impact on the lives of people all over EARTH.

Our intention with EARTH, from day 1, has been to leverage emerging technologies to have a positive impact on the Human Condition. EARTH sits at the intersection of the Web, the Blockchain and the Internet of Things and we intend to create disruptive technology and license it as open source to get it in to the hands of as many people as possible and as quickly as possible.

We view the mask as a great opportunity to have a positive impact on people's lives during the COVID-19 Pandemic and to take Facetop computing mainstream.

## Sword of Damocles

<div class="centered chart">
  <img src="/assets/damocles.jpg" alt="sword of damocles">
</div>

In legend of the [sword of Damocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles) there is a man named Damocles sitting before the King Dionysus. Damocles is telling the King how amazing it must be to be the King, with all his wealth and power. Dionysus offers to let Damocles be King-for-a-day so that he too can feel what it's like to be King.

Damocles jumps at the offer but just as he is taking his place at the throne Dionysus arranges a huge sword above the throne. The sword was held by a single horse hair. The purpose was immediately clear to Damocles&mdash;the King may have much fortune, but he is in constant anxiety and fear about who might try and overtake them.

Technology is in it's own way a Sword of Damocles situation. We are offered abilities which our ancestors would see as nearly Godlike but in return we sacrifice our personal liberties and privacy. Does it have to be that way? Can we architect systems which empower human liberty? Can we put people in control of their data and offer them privacy? As long as we have strong encryption, which is under attack by govts around the world, we believe that we can build such systems.

## Join us

Necessity is the mother of invention and we believe that in crisis there is opportunity. We're a species of problem solvers and we have the wisdom needed to overcome nearly any crisis.

Part of our mission with Facetop is to take something which is being forced upon us during a time of fear and uncertainty, the mandatory wearing of a mask, and taking ownership of it and ultimately being empowered by it.

Masks are here to stay, for at least a couple of years, so we're choosing to be empowered instead of disempowered. We're choosing to view this as an opportunity to have a positive impact on the lives of people during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as helping to take Facetop computing mainstream. We hope that you'll join us.

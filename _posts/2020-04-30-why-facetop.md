## Introduction

We believe that in crisis there is opportunity. We are a species of problem solvers and we have the wisdom needed to overcome any crisis.

Part of my mission with Facetop is to take something which is being forced upon us during a time of fear and uncertainty, the mandatory wearing of a mask, and taking ownership of it and ultimately being empowered by it.

## Point of View

Instead of viewing the mask as a symbol of us losing our voices I view the mask as something which protects us, can be fashionable and connect us to the Internet of Things. Instead of masks representing us losing our identity, they can instead represent us embracing our pseudonymity.

Facetop computing has been long overdue for a catalyst. Google Glass and subsequent "smart-glasses" haven't captured the public imagination. Mandatory masks worldwide represent an enormous opportunity for Facetop computing to go mainstream and will represent as large of a paradigm shift as Desktop and Mobile computing. Conventions and frameworks needed to protect privacy and provide developers the tools needed to create engaging and meaningful experiences will need to be developed. Facetop computing is a greenfield opportunity where everything is fresh and needs to be created in a way which best serves the new medium.

## Please join me

Masks are here to stay for at least a couple of years so I'm choosing to be empowered instead of disempowered. I'm choosing to view this an opportunity to have a positive impact on the lives of people during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as helping to take Facetop computing mainstream. I hope that you'll join me.

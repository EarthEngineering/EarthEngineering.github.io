## Introduction

According to [Security Today](https://securitytoday.com/articles/2020/01/13/the-iot-rundown-for-2020.aspx), during 2020 global spending on the Internet of Things (IoT) should reach $1.29 trillion. By 2021&mdash;the industrial IoT market size should reach $124 billion. By 2024&mdash;the global IoT healthcare market should reach $14 billion. By 2026&mdash;experts estimate that the IoT device market will reach $1.1 trillion.

It's clear that the Internet of Things is going to be massive and that it's here to stay. Facetop computing has been waiting for an IoT catalyst and due to COVID-19 we belive smart-masks will be gateway that takes Facetop computing mainstream.

## Components

### Raspberry Pi

At the heart Facetop is the Raspberry Pi which comes fully equipped with a Broadcom system on a chip (SoC) with an integrated ARM-compatible CPU and on-chip GPU. Processor speed is 1.5 GHz with 4 GiB of RAM. HDMI, 3.5mm audio jack as well as WIFI and Bluetooth leave many ways to get data on/off the device.

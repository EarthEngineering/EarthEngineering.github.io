Facetop computing represents as large of a paradigm shift as desktop and mobile computing. Wearing smart-masks presents the opportunity to engage with information, data and computation which is uniquely personal. We believe that Facetop computing is a HUGE leap forward and we hope that our work can have a positive impact on the lives of people around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Based in the SF Bay area, EARTH sits at the intersection of the Web, IoT and Blockchain.
